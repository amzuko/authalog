Store subgoal failure in results / proofs somehow?
Index clauses
Primitive functions + bindings to sql example
Explanation formatting strings
Cache invalidation -- HOW?
Static errors
    Track parse position
    Feed back along with errors
    Negation inside recursion
    Calling relations with wrong # of arguments
Docstring comments on rules
Web UI for interacting with db
Pass errors up through querying
External sql relations 
    verify that types match 

Concurrent use of database
    Locks in interning
    Locks on results
    Locks around invalidation
    Snapshots for consistent querying?
